- [x] **Engineering & QA** — Execute the staged mypy remediation plan to drive error count toward zero.
  - notes: Typed Hypothesis wrappers, optional-dependency stubs, CLI/MCP typing, and long-tail cleanup completed; mypy baseline archived.

- [x] Document expected staging artefacts for Prefect backfill guardrails and ARC runner sign-off runs so evidence drops into dist/staging/backfill/ and dist/staging/arc/ when access resumes (owner: Platform & QA).
  - notes: docs/operations/staging-rehearsal-plan.md now includes capture instructions and destinations for both rehearsal tracks.
  - checks: tests=unknown, lint=unknown, type=unknown, sec=unknown, build=unknown
- [x] **Types remediation roadmap (Engineering & QA)** — execute the staged plan and record checkpoints.
