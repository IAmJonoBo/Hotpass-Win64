# Hotpass Web UI — Functional Implementation Playbook

> Source of truth: README.md, docs/**, DESIGN_REVIEW.md, apps/web-ui/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (no IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_WEB_UI.md in repo)

---

## 0. Pre-flight Setup

- [ ] Confirm local stack (Prefect, Marquez, Hotpass CLI) reachable or start via `docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml up`.
- [ ] Ensure `uv` extras match target profile (`dev orchestration enrichment geospatial compliance dashboards`).
- [ ] Snapshot current `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run lint`, Playwright baseline (if available).

---

## Stage 1 – Backend job skeleton & health checks (apps/web-ui/server/index.mjs)

- [x] Job registry + command runner wrapper (`POST /api/commands/run`, `GET /api/jobs*`).
- [x] Generic job SSE stream (`GET /api/jobs/:id/events`) with keep-alives.
- [x] Health endpoint enhanced with uptime + job telemetry.
- [ ] Smoke tests for job runner (follow-up: add Vitest suite targeting `server/job-runner.js`).

---

## Stage 2 – Import pipeline backend (apps/web-ui/server/index.mjs)

- [ ] Add `/api/import` (multipart) → spawn `uv run hotpass refine` in temp workspace.
- [ ] Implement job registry updates for granular events (file/sheet/row/cell).
- [ ] `/api/import/:id/events` SSE payload design (≤500 ms cadence).
- [ ] Persist artifacts under `dist/import/<job-id>/`.

---

## Stage 3 – Frontend import integration (operator view)

### 2.1 Replace mocks
- [ ] `DatasetImportPanel` → call `/api/import`, subscribe to events, surface download links once done.
- [ ] DatasetImportPanel → render live processing panel (rolling 20-row/cell timeline) fed by granular SSE events (file-accepted, sheet-parsed, row-validated, cell-fixed, artifact-ready).
- [ ] DatasetImportPanel → show milestone progress bar with stages: Upload → Parse → Validate → Publish; animate each stage (≤200 ms) and pulse on completion.
- [ ] DatasetImportPanel → expose expandable detail section: collapsed for non-technical operators, expanded for technical operators (progressive disclosure).
- [ ] `LiveRefinementPanel` → consume `/api/runs/recent` (React Query polling/SSE fallback), show real data-docs link.
- [ ] LiveRefinementPanel → highlight newly arriving runs/logs for 2 s (background tint + fade) to emphasise real-time work.
- [ ] `AgentActivityPanel` → subscribe to `/api/activity`.
- [ ] `useHILApprovals` / `ApprovalPanel` → swap to new REST endpoints.
- [ ] `TelemetryStrip` → include backend job/command failures.

### 2.2 Assistant tool expansion (`src/agent/tools.ts`)
- [ ] Add wrappers: `runRefine`, `runEnrich`, `runQa`, `runPlanResearch`, `runContracts`.
- [ ] Return `{jobId, statusUrl, logUrl}` for UI to render.
- [ ] Update chat UI to stream tool responses & link to logs/RunDetails.

### 2.3 Error handling
- [ ] Create shared toast/banner system (reuse `ApiBanner` variants).
- [ ] Surface inline errors for uploads, approvals, assistant failures.

---

## Stage 4 – Engineer view & log streaming

### 3.1 Dashboard (operator-first)
- [ ] Guided ingest wizard (dropzone + status timeline).
- [ ] “Latest refined workbook” card, “Data quality” summary chip.
- [ ] Live processing widget showing: current workbook name, sheet count, processed rows, auto-fixes, errors needing review, and session duration (updated every 200–500 ms).
- [ ] Optional "cell spotlight" panel that shows the most recently processed cell (e.g. Sheet2!D14) and rule applied ("Normalised country code").
- [ ] Pending approvals panel (link to RunDetails).
- [ ] Inline help links (HelpCenter anchors).

### 3.2 RunDetails (technical depth)
- [ ] Stream live logs (SSE) with tail component.
- [ ] New events (logs, cell-fixed, validation-failed) should briefly glow (≤200 ms) and then settle to normal state.
- [ ] Provide link-back to source rule / contract when an auto-fix is displayed, so users can stay in-app (no hard context switch to docs).
- [ ] QA viewer embedded from `dist/data-docs` (iframe) & JSON summary.
- [ ] Buttons for `Re-run`, `Enrich`, `Plan research`, `Explain provenance`.
- [ ] Approval audit timeline (backend data).

### 3.3 Research & governance
- [ ] Add planner tab (form for `plan research`, results viewer).
- [ ] Contracts explorer (list YAML from `dist/contracts/` with download).
- [ ] Data Docs global page or modal (link from sidebar).

### 3.4 Power tools
- [ ] Replace “copy command” with invocation via `/api/commands/run`.
- [ ] Provide log modal with tail + download.

---

## Stage 5 – Live refinement/approvals replacement (real data)

- [ ] Leverage `useAuth().hasRole` to toggle advanced controls.
- [ ] Persist view preference (simple vs advanced) per user.
- [ ] Ensure assistant respects role gating (tool contract filtered by role).

---

## Stage 6 – Assistant + power tool upgrades

### 5.1 Real-time updates
- [ ] Decide SSE vs polling for each panel (DatasetImport, LiveRefinement, Activity).
- [ ] Prefer SSE for one-way, high-frequency updates from import/validation pipelines (see patterns in Ably, FreeCodeCamp, and recent SSE vs WebSocket guidance).
- [ ] Fall back to polling (5–10 s) only for Prefect/Marquez endpoints that cannot stream.
- [ ] Cap live UI lists to 20–50 items to avoid reflow/jank and archive older events server-side.
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders & “last updated” capsules (per DESIGN_REVIEW).

### 5.2 Error banners & transparency
- [ ] Propagate Prefect/Marquez outage info to Dashboard header.
- [ ] Warn when Admin endpoints point to private VPC (per Stage 7 requirement).

### 5.3 Accessibility & responsiveness
- [ ] Validate focus outlines, keyboard flow, screen reader labels.
- [ ] Ensure tables degrade gracefully <1024px (horizontal scroll hints/cards).

### 5.4 Engagement & microinteractions
- [ ] Upload dropzone: on drop → scale to 1.02 and swap to parsing state; on success → morph into summary card (sheet count, rows, timestamp).
- [ ] Buttons that trigger long-running jobs should show in-button progress (spinner + "Working…") for first 1–2 s and then hand over to the live processing panel. Avoid only-global toasts.
- [ ] Activity feed entries should be timestamped in SAST (UTC+2) and badge for 3 s when new.
- [ ] All animations ≤200 ms; no opacity-only animations—combine slight translate to convey direction.

---

## Stage 7 – Research & governance surfaces

- [ ] Unit: job state machine, API clients, assistant tools, HIL mutations (Vitest).
- [ ] E2E: Playwright scenarios (ingest→completion, approvals workflow, assistant run trigger, Data Docs viewer).
- [ ] Storybook: new states for DatasetImport, LiveRefinement, Assistant, PowerTools, TelemetryStrip.
- [ ] Update `apps/web-ui/TEST_PLAN.md` with scenarios & role coverage.
- [ ] Document new endpoints + usage in docs (likely `docs/how-to-guides` + README updates).

---

## Stage 8 – UX polish, accessibility, and test hardening

- [ ] `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, Playwright suite pass.
- [ ] Manual verification: ingestion workflow, run monitoring, approvals persistence, assistant tool execution.
- [ ] Write implementation summary (diff overview, outstanding risks).
- [ ] Update roadmap / DESIGN_REVIEW checklist items toggled to ✅.
