# Compliance — SOC 2 maturity matrix

| Control (TSC)             | Current maturity                                                                                               | Target state                                                                 | Gap & risk                                                               | Risk severity | Evidence                                                                                                                               | Control owner           | Remediation                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CC1.1 Control environment | Governance charter establishes tone, but no formalised code of conduct for operators.                          | Signed code of conduct with onboarding checklist and annual acknowledgement. | Without codified expectations, auditors may question ethical foundation. | Medium        | [`docs/governance/project-charter.md`](../../governance/project-charter.md).                                                           | Leadership & People Ops | [Backlog: SOC2-001](../remediation-backlog.md#soc2-001-publish-code-of-conduct)         |
| CC3.2 Risk assessment     | Threat model enumerates risks, yet there is no documented risk register tying likelihood/impact to treatments. | Living risk register with scoring, owners, and quarterly review.             | Missing register obscures prioritisation of mitigations.                 | High          | [`docs/security/threat-model.md`](../../security/threat-model.md); risk register to be maintained at `docs/security/risk-register.md`. | Security                | [Backlog: SOC2-002](../remediation-backlog.md#soc2-002-maintain-risk-register)          |
| CC6.1 Change management   | QA pipeline enforces tests/linters, but change approvals not logged outside GitHub reviews.                    | Change record capturing reviewer sign-off and deployment outcome.            | Incomplete change logs hinder SOC 2 audit trail.                         | Medium        | [`.github/workflows/process-data.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/process-data.yml); GitHub PR history.                                | Engineering             | [Backlog: SOC2-003](../remediation-backlog.md#soc2-003-enhance-change-records)          |
| CC7.2 Monitoring          | Prefect and OpenTelemetry capture runtime metrics; alert thresholds not defined.                               | Alert catalog with thresholds, escalation chain, and runbook links.          | Without thresholds, monitoring coverage cannot be proven.                | Medium        | [`docs/metrics/metrics-plan.md`](../../metrics/metrics-plan.md); Prefect telemetry configuration.                                      | Observability           | [Backlog: SOC2-004](../remediation-backlog.md#soc2-004-define-alert-thresholds)         |
| CC9.2 Confidentiality     | Data exports stored locally with manual access controls.                                                       | Access-controlled storage with audit logging and encryption at rest.         | Manual controls may miss unauthorised access events.                     | High          | [`docs/explanations/architecture.md`](../../explanations/architecture.md); export logs to be archived under `dist/logs/access/`.       | Platform                | [Backlog: SOC2-005](../remediation-backlog.md#soc2-005-harden-confidentiality-controls) |

Unknowns:

- Decide whether SOC 2 scope covers Streamlit dashboard hosting environments or only CLI/Prefect boundaries.
- Confirm confidentiality control expectations for customer-provided enrichment keys.
