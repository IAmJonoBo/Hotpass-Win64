# Hotpass Commercial License

n00tropic offers commercial terms for customers who need production rights beyond the Business Source License 1.1 Additional Use Grant. Contact [security@n00tropic.example](mailto:security@n00tropic.example) to request pricing, support SLAs, and bespoke licensing language. Commercial agreements supersede the BSL terms for the covered deployments and include:

- Expanded production use and redistribution rights.
- Access to n00tropic support engineers and security advisories.
- Optional managed services, roadmap alignment, and indemnity coverage.

Include details about your deployment footprint, timelines, and compliance obligations so the stewardship team can scope the appropriate contract.
